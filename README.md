## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This time i worked on the mobile design first. Should have added event listeners to change img source.. but maybe next time. You need to manually reload the page to change images.
